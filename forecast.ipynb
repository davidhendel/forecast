    "First we create the streampepper dynamical models for each stream. This is done by make_streampepper_models file which has the necessary parameters and uses them to call the streammodel_util.py file. The latter generalizes the old pal5_util and gd1_util files. There will be a separate leading-tail and trailing-tail model for each. We also introduce the coordinate transformations here for convenience; each model has the Astropy frame as sdf.stream_coord for convenience.\n",
